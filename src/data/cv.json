    "summary": "Passionate about code quality, style, and maintainability. I enjoy teaching, playing music, and riding bikes. I started writing code back in the MySpace days (2006) tweaking HTML/CSS. In my job as an IT tech I realized a paper based method of record keeping could be made more efficient and less error prone if I created an app for it. I sat down to read a few chapters of PHP/MySQL and realized I was a natural at understanding code and logic. I fell in love with building apps and taught myself enough to get hired professionally as a web developer. I continued soaking up books, articles, documentation, and QAs to get to where I am today. Now, I specialize in complex multi-process systems in service oriented architectures. I'm proficient in migrating monolithic Rails apps to hybrid service oriented designs. I write developer tools for automation and productivity. I enthusiastically talk about code and mentor coworkers and juniors. I love conversing about science and I'll talk about the universe for hours.",
