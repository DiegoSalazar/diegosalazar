I enjoy teaching, playing music, and riding bikes. I started writing code back in the MySpace days (2006) tweaking HTML/CSS. In my job as an IT tech I realized a paper based method of record keeping could be made more efficient and less error prone if I created an app for it. I sat down to read a few chapters of PHP/MySQL and realized I was a natural at understanding code and logic. I fell in love with building apps and taught myself enough to get hired professionally as a web developer. I continued soaking up books, articles, documentation, and QAs to get to where I am today. Now, I specialize in complex multi-process systems in service oriented architectures. I'm proficient in migrating monolithic Rails apps to hybrid service oriented designs. I write developer tools for automation and productivity. I enthusiastically talk about code and mentor coworkers and juniors. I love conversing about science and I'll talk about the universe for hours.</p></div></div></section><section class="py-20" id="projects"><div class="max-w-6xl mx-auto"><h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold tracking-tighter mb-12 text-center">Projects</h2><div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8"><div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg overflow-hidden transform transition-transform hover:scale-105 shadow-lg"><img class="w-full h-48 object-cover" src="assets/images/projects/conways.png" alt="Conway's Game of Life"><div class="p-6"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Conway's Game of Life</h3><p class="text-gray-400 mt-2 flex-grow">An HTML5/Canvas/Javascript implementation of the famous cellular automaton Conway's Game of Life</p><div class="mt-4"><a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline mr-4" href="https://diegosalazar.github.io/ConwaysGameOfLife/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Project</a><a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" href="https://github.com/DiegoSalazar/ConwaysGameOfLife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on GitHub</a></div></div></div><div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg overflow-hidden transform transition-transform hover:scale-105 shadow-lg"><img class="w-full h-48 object-cover" src="assets/images/projects/circlewaves.png" alt="Circle Waves - A Web Toy"><div class="p-6"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Circle Waves - A Web Toy</h3><p class="text-gray-400 mt-2 flex-grow">An HTML/Javascript based toy inspired by an entrancing Gif.</p><div class="mt-4"><a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline mr-4" href="https://diegosalazar.github.io/CircleWaves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Project</a><a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" href="https://github.com/DiegoSalazar/CircleWaves" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on GitHub</a></div></div></div><div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg overflow-hidden transform transition-transform hover:scale-105 shadow-lg"><img class="w-full h-48 object-cover" src="assets/images/projects/defretry.png" alt="Defretry - Method Retry Micro-library"><div class="p-6"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Defretry - Method Retry Micro-library</h3><p class="text-gray-400 mt-2 flex-grow">Rubygem to add configurable retry logic to methods and blocks of code.</p><div class="mt-4"><a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline mr-4" href="https://github.com/DiegoSalazar/DefRetry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Project</a><a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" href="https://github.com/DiegoSalazar/DefRetry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on GitHub</a></div></div></div><div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg overflow-hidden transform transition-transform hover:scale-105 shadow-lg"><img class="w-full h-48 object-cover" src="assets/images/projects/gifantry.png" alt="Gifantry - Personal Image Organizer"><div class="p-6"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Gifantry - Personal Image Organizer</h3><p class="text-gray-400 mt-2 flex-grow">Rails based open source web app that allows bulk upload and categorization/tagging of images and allows full text search and quick direct link copy.</p><div class="mt-4"><a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline mr-4" href="https://gifantry.herokuapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Project</a><a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" href="https://github.com/DiegoSalazar/gifantry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on GitHub</a></div></div></div><div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg overflow-hidden transform transition-transform hover:scale-105 shadow-lg"><img class="w-full h-48 object-cover" src="assets/images/projects/wordlick.png" alt="Wordlick - Hangman Solver"><div class="p-6"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Wordlick - Hangman Solver</h3><p class="text-gray-400 mt-2 flex-grow">Solves Hangman.
